# SETUP GUIDE FOR SHADOWGATE 64 ARCHIPELAGO

## Important

As we are using BizHawk, this guide is only applicable to Windows and Linux systems.

## Required Software and Hardware

-   BizHawk:  [BizHawk Releases from TASVideos](https://tasvideos.org/BizHawk/ReleaseHistory)
    -   Version <b>2.9.1</b> and later are supported.
    -   Detailed installation instructions for BizHawk can be found at the above link.
    -   Windows users must run the prereq installer first, which can also be found at the above link.
-   A Shadowgate 64 ROM (English).
-   The github releases contains the shadowgate64 connector. Put this in your <b>Archipelago\data\lua</b> folder.

## Playing on BizHawk
### Configuring BizHawk

Once BizHawk has been installed, open EmuHawk and change the following settings:

-   Under Config > Customize, check the "Run in background" and "Accept background input" boxes. This will allow you to continue playing in the background, even if another window is selected.
-   Under Config > Hotkeys, many hotkeys are listed, with many bound to common keys on the keyboard. You will likely want to disable most of these, which you can do quickly using  `Esc`.
-   If playing with a controller, when you bind controls, disable "P1 A Up", "P1 A Down", "P1 A Left", and "P1 A Right" as these interfere with aiming if bound. Set directional input using the Analog tab instead.
-   Under N64 enable "Use Expansion Slot". (The N64 menu only appears after loading a ROM.)
-   Under Config -> Speed/Skip, I recommend playing on speeds between 150% or 200%.

It is strongly recommended to associate N64 rom extensions (*.n64, *.z64) to the EmuHawk we've just installed. To do so, we simply have to search any N64 rom we happened to own, right click and select "Open withâ€¦", unfold the list that appears and select the bottom option "Look for another application", then browse to the BizHawk folder and select EmuHawk.exe.

### Setup - BizHawk
- Run Launcher.exe and select Shadowgate 64 Client
- If this is your first time running this version, it will prompt for your Shadowgate 64 ROM
- The patched rom is located in your Archipelago root folder
    - The exact path is also printed on the Shadowgate 64 Client
    - You can also click "Browse Files" in the Launcher which will take you to this folder
- Connect the Archipelago Client with the server.
    - To connect the client to the multiserver simply put  `<address>:<port>`  on the textfield on top and press `connect` (if the server uses password, then it will prompt after connection).
- Open Bizhawk (2.9.1+) and open your patched Shadowgate 64 game
- Once you are in the game title menu or game select screen, drag and drop the shadowgate64_connector lua script (which should be data/lua folder of Archipelago) onto the Lua console window.
