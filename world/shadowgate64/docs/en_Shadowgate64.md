## What does randomization do to this game?
### As you receive random items, certain questlines would break due to sequence breaking. A lot of changes was done in order to remedy this and make the game as playable as possible.

- Opening dungeon cutscene is skipped (QOL)
- Falling, drowning or getting sliced to pieces will take you back to where you have last entered (QOL)
- Handing over most* items will remove it from your inventory. Some items are delayed due to technicality reasons.
    - Pair of Slippers isn't removed until the Stone of Thirst Check is obtained.
    - Stringless Violin & Broken Violin will remain in your inventory.
    - Fairy & Elf Statues isn't removed until the Statue Puzzle is solved.
    - Jezibel's Pendant isn't removed from your inventory.
- The Candle in the Trial Maze will never run out.
- You can take the candle from the candlestick while having the candle in your inventory to obtain a check.
- The Dungeon Key item will always be at its original location to avoid a softlock.
- After saving Agaar while not yet talking to her sister, Agaar's Door will be open and you will still be able to talk to her sister to complete that check.
    - In-game dialog will remind you that you can still talk to Agaar's sister after saving him.
- If you have removed the water from the Trials Tower and have not yet returned Kaitlin, <b>Wear the Ring of the Dead in the courtyard</b> to temporarily bring the water back and speak with her. Unequip the ring in the Coutyard to let the water drain again.
- The <b>Pendant, Flint, Staff</b> item will always be at the Dragon to avoid the town being alerted and being locked out part of the map.
    - If you have done this check while not yet obtaining the Pendant or Flint and you are locked out on part of the map, <b>The guard guarding the Evacuation Site is removed.</b>
    - If you have all 3 items but you still don't have the means to beat the game (still checks in your game), show Saul the pendant so the guards will go away.
