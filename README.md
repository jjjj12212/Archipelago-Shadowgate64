# Archipelago Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers | 0.1
Shadowgate 64: Trails of the Four Towers for Archipelago 

# Current Implementation
## Randomized Collectibles
- All Books
- All Notes
- All Items except The Dungeon Key & Bone.

## Goals
- Beating the game

## Progressive Items
- Pendant, Flint, Staff item which when collected all three, will make the guards "alerted".

## Quality of life / Additional Features
- Dungeon Keeper walking intro is skipped
- Falling / Drowning to death does not end your run
- The Candle in the Trial Maze will never run out
- After saving Agaar while not yet talking to her sister, Agaar's Door will be open and you will still be able to talk to her sister to complete that check.
    - In-game dialog will remind you that you can still talk to Agaar's sister after saving him.
- If you have removed the water from the Trials Tower and have not yet returned Kaitlin, <b>Wear the Ring of the Dead in the courtyard</b> to temporarily bring the water back and speak with her. Unequip the ring in the Coutyard to let the water drain again.
- The Dungeon Key item will always be at its original location to avoid a softlock.
- The <b>Pendant, Flint, Staff</b> item will always be at the Dragon to avoid the town being alerted and being locked out part of the map.
- If you have all 3 progressive items but you still don't have the means to beat the game (still checks in your game), show Saul the pendant so the guards will go away.
